Softwathics (Software Engineering Ethics) to me means something that is fair and has a positive impact on the community. By fair, to me it means something that is well-balanced. Something that isn't overly too much of something nor is it too less. A very simple but good example could be a scale. When it is completely even between the two weights, it is fair, however if one side tends to drop down lower than the other, then it is considered not fair. 

Having a positive impact on the community is also definitely a big part of Softwathics. To me, as a software engineer I want to be able to design and create something that everyone can use that will be beneficial to them in some way or another. Of course, no one would want to use software that is detrimental to them or does nothing. Ethics is what differentiates Software Engineers from hackers with malicious intent. They do not have nor believe in ethics, they just want to cause havoc and negative impacts to the community or anyone that they are targeting for their own profit. One of the ACM code of ethics generally states that you must contribute to the society and the well-being of humanity, designing systems that are used in socially responsible ways, meet social needs, and avoid harmful effects to health and welfare. 

I chose a situation from the case study "The code I'm still ashamed of" to analyze. The author had basically quit his job after hearing about a girl that had committed suicide on the news. She had died from the drug that he was helping to promote via a quiz taking system. I have chosen the authors position in the story to analyze with respect to its ethical implications. As the author, I would've tried to do some research on the drug that I am told to promote. If I find out that it ends up killing people, I will not just quit but I will try and find something that is fair to not only the client but also to the company. I have a responsibility not only to the people / society but also to the company. It will be about balancing the two responsibilities on the scale to be as fair as possible to both ends. I will still work for the company but possibly try and find other options that I can take that would not affect my ethics. I could do so by just trying to propose different things that would stray away from the drug, or even make my quizzes as honest as possible and not make them not rigged as they were in the story. To balance it out with society, I can help raise awareness of the drug and what it can do to you. Therefore, keeping the people aware of their risks and having a positive impact on the society in general. Balancing both responsibilities to the people and to the company will mean having an equal amount of sacrifices and gains. Not only will it be balanced but I will also be contributing to the positive impact on society and well-being of humanity. This is my opinion as to the ethical stance that had to be taken in terms of Softwathics where being fair and having a positive impact on the community is necessary.
