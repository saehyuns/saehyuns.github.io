My interest in software engineering is the fact that it will always be a never ending learning process. For music, sports, and even singing, there are such people who are revered as "prodigies". In Computer Science, there is no such thing as a "prodigy". Everyone starts off the same, no one will be good right off the bat when coding. It is a completely foreign thing that humans are not used to when they first begin. The only way to improve and get better is through trial and error, there is no such thing as "perfect". It moreso about how much you dedicate yourself to trial and error and learning from those experiences over time. 

Skills that I hope to develop in the future is to be able to adapt to future languages that will come across my way. Eventually, the languages that we know today will be come obsolete as newer improved languages come out. I will always have to be ready for that to happen. Who knows, C++ might be really good today, but tomorrow someone could release something even better and before you know it, all the time and effort that you put into C++ syntax has become obsolete. 

Experiences that I hope to develop in the future is the experience of not only working for a company but also experience managing and running my own company. In the future, I see myself as someone who will be hiring other professionals with the same values and visions as I do. Creating a company, a group of talented individuals that can come together to achieve things that people thought were impossible. Although I may not have it all figured out right now in terms of my ideals, visions, and values. Through trial and error, experiences, and learning from my mistakes, I believe that hard work and dedication will help me achieve the experience of running a company in the future.
