After my first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, I feel as though it is useful in some cases but not in all cases. Yes, it is good if you want consistency in your code in terms of legibility, precision, and organization. However, in terms of being able to express your own style of code, where no one else but you are going to be looking at it, it might not be as good. There will always be the same pattern to a coding standard, whilst if you have your own unique standard, it might be a bit harder for someone else with either malicious intent or someone with the idea of taking your code, it will make it much difficult for them to interpret. I personally think that it depends on what you use it for. Of course, if you are working a large group, consistency through coding standards is good since it puts everyone on the same page and everyone will be able to interpret what the code shows. Everyone will be coding using the same pattern or coding standard. I believe that the green checkmark itself is useful, it tells you that something is wrong format or even missing something. Without something like that green checkmark that would indicate something, you might not catch something that was important. It might be weird to think of it like this, but it sort of just takes away the unique way everyone expresses themselves through code. Through their own coding standards and their own ways of coding. Having the same coding standard would make everyone's style look almost exactly the same, all consolidated into one type of standard, that has to be boring right? Of course, that would depend on the person looking at the code as well. Overall, I feel that having coding standards has its own pros and cons just like everything else in this world, everyone will always have their own perspective of everything.
