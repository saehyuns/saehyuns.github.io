When one hears JavaScript, one might think, "Oh! I know Java, it should basically be the same thing, right?". Well, that "one"
was me. Coming into this class, not knowing any JavaScript, I was expecting it to be very similar in terms of syntax with Java.
However, that was not the case. After watching Professor Johnson's video about the differences between JavaScript and C++/Java,
it gave me a whole new perspective of what I was going to learning. One notable thing is that you can mix different
types in the same array, IN THE SAME ARRAY. I never thought that would be possible, especially since Java/C/C++ were my starting
languages. Having different types in the same array, opens up new possibilities that wouldn't be possible with the restrictions.

From a software engineering perspective, JavaScript is a good programming language. The usability and readability makes more sense
than that of the traditional C, C++, and Java programming languages. I feel like it would be easier for beginners to learn 
JavaScript than they would for the traditional languages. All programming languages have their pros and cons, it would come down to
what you want to achieve and the preference for the language that you like.

Being introduced to WODS for the first time in my life, I feel as though they are very helpful in terms of not only preparing us for 
the professional/technical interviews but also keeps us on our toes of JavaScript or the current material that we are learning.
It is like when you workout, at first when your muscles are not used to working out, they will be in pain and in
"shock", however as you become more consistent in working out, your muscles will no longer be as shocked as they were when you first
worked out. Athletic software engineering behaves the exact same way but mentally. It is very much enjoyable and I believe that it
will work for not only me but everyone else as well.
