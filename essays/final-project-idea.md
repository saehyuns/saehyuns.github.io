Project: My Gaming Buddies

Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”):
The Problem: There are generally too many anti-social gamers at UH Manoa. UH Manoa gamers generally just play with themselves or with their close group of friends prior to college. It is also hard to find someone else with the same game interest and time frames of which they can play with each other. Therefore, My Gaming Buddies is an application which tries to bridge the gap between anti-social gamers to increase communication and social interaction between each other. 

The Solution: The My Gaming Buddies application allows students to login and create a profile indicating their gaming tastes, their gaming capabilities, their gaming goals (playing for fun or competitively / against or with each other), and their gaming times. The profile can include links to their gaming profiles containing their IGN, etc. (Ex. Steam, Blizzard, Maplestory, etc) Once a profile is created, other can browse the profiles filtered by specific gaming tastes, capabilities, goals, and times. Students can also be notified if a match has been found and has the option of contacting the person via the information that the matching person(s) provided. Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content, create new categories of gaming tastes, goals, capabilities, and to ban anyone who violates the Terms of Use and Conditions. Both student and admins can log in with their UH account. Include a link to a discord page for My Gaming Buddies so that people can interact with each other via a very widely used, popular VoIP application.

Mockup page ideas:
Some possible mockup pages include:
Login Page
User Home Page
Admin Home Page
User Profile Page
Public Landing Page
Game / Discord directory page.
Browse users by their interest, goals, tastes, capabilities, etc.


Use case ideas:
New user goes to the landing page and logs in, gets to the home page, sets up their profile, etc.
Admin goes to the landing page, logs in, and edits/monitors activity of the users.
User goes to landing page, logs in, and browses for other posssible gamers.

Beyond the basics:
Rating system for the profiles, where you can only positively rate someone and not negatively rate someone.
