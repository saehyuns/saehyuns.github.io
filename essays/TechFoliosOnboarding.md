# Interest

As a former ICS 314 student having experienced what it's like to build and use Techfolios I completely agreed with the motivation behind why Techfolio Designer was built. During my ICS 314 class, I noticed that a lot of student s have struggled trying to build Techfolio and get it working. It could've been because JSON file was in a wrong format, spelling errors, and many other tiny cumbersome things that we CS people have to account for. I hope that I can contribute to the best of my ability in the development of TechFolio Designer to help students with no prior exposure to Github, Markdown, etc create their professional portfolios with very little to no problem.

# Problems

I believe that one of the subtle but biggest problems that I ran into myself  when creating my professional portfolio was editing the JSON file. Whenever I would update my portfolio and it would not update, I immediately knew that the problem came from the formatting of the JSON file I had edited. The problem could be that it was missing a comma, curly brace, etc. The problem being really small, had actually affected the entire portfolio drastically. One way I used to counteract this was by using a web application called [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com) which would check for any errors in my JSON file. 

Problems I ran into while using a binary release of Techfolio Designer was that I could not copy and paste text into and from the application, I would have to log in three times in order to get everything set up, and when I was updating the work section of the biography, there was no way to move my most recent work experience to the top, I would have to delete everything and re-enter it into the first field. As of right now, I do not know how these problems will be solved, but as I delve deeper and start to understand the application, frameworks, and languages much better I will be able to hopefully solve these problems.

I did not encounter any problems while setting up my development environment.

# Improvements

I hope to help improve everything in general, from the front-end to the back-end of the application.
