Design patterns are defined as a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem. More specifically, I will be going
over design patterns in software engineering. You can think of design patterns like a new house. If a commonly 
occurring problem is that a home is much needed and are looking for one. The new house can serve as a template, where it isn't 
finished and only partially satisfies the problem. After buying the new house AKA template, you wouldn't want to just
live in a home with nothing in it. You would want to get some dishware, refrigerators, and other home necessities. Those necessities
along with additional conveniences make the house more complete. It ends up becoming a complete solution to your problem as time
goes on. It can be used in many different situations such as the location, interior, or even the exterior of the home. It all has
to start with a new house first regardless of the locations, exterior, or even exterior that they want. The interior and exterior can 
be modified or added onto the empty house. 

Some design patterns I used in my own code would be semantic classes such as button or card. The button class in semantic
acts as a design pattern because it starts off with an initial template of a button and you can modify the class to fit whatever
situation that you would like it to solve. It becomes a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem of needing a 
button to behave in certain ways in certain situations. Another would be the card class. This class is used repeatedly as a template for our final project. We have a game list and event list which both use 
the card class to display certain data. Although they both use the same template, they have different contents, pictures, borders,
etc. to fit the specific need of a certain situation. This would be a design pattern since the card is used as a template for 
a commonly occurring problem of needing to display data in a nice way (it basically looks like cards with data on it). From that,
since it isn't a finished design, it can be modified or added onto based off what the developer thinks would be best for
that scenario. For example, the game list would use the card class template but would contain information about games, have a cool
looking picture, and a background / border related to games. On the other hand, the event list uses the same template but is used
to contain information about events, dates, times, locations, etc. In the end, design patterns are very useful in cutting the time
it takes to solve repeated problems as well as providing a sense of direction from the unfinished design that it provides.
