Did you feel these past few weeks like you were hit on the head with “a small body of matter from outer space that enters the earth’s atmosphere, becoming incandescent as a result of friction and appearing as a streak of light”? Well, I did. Given that there is an initial learning curve for Meteor, what I found difficult was trying to transition from just creating little programs that would display how data structures works
to creating an application that would be used in the real world today. As explained in class, it is something that has
a much larger market than that of creating a program that demonstrates a linked list. Transitioning from that background
to real-life application development and being introduced to a different way of coding has really caught my attention. 
I did not really find anything to be easy while going through the Meteor WODS. What I found cool was that you can see the 
results of every action you make on the website each time you press save or after a certain period. I found it 
interesting that there was more to website development that I initially thought. I mainly thought it was just HTML but there’s 
also, a back-end part which handles the data manipulation, storage, retrieval, etc. 

My first impression of Meteor as an application architecture is that it was weird and was something that I was not really used
to. I was more used to either using the IDE (Eclipse) for Java and using Vi / Vim for C / C++ / Scripting. It was new for me to
use HTML code and to connect it to the back-end with JavaScript / MongoDB commands to do something with database management and 
queries and reflect it on the website via HTML. However, after using it for a bit, it had sparked my interest in web
development and would like to try and go further into it. I also feel that the other classes should have a similar style of 
teaching and having the students develop something that would be more applicable in the future relevant to what is being learned
in the class.
