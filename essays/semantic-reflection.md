Semantic UI is my first-ever framework that I've used thus far. It is complicated to learn, but simple to master. Now, one
might think that it's usually the other way around. Simple to learn but hard to master. Semantic UI, I feel that although
it may be very complicated in the beginning, as time goes on and you learn to use it, it starts to become very simple in a 
sense where you are pretty much repeating your previous experiments and trials. Why should we even bother learning something
like Semantic UI? First, we're not Graphic Artists, if you are, good for you. But as software engineers, we don't want
to invest our time into learning about graphics when we can simply just use Semantic UI to produce the same output as someone
who had invested time in learning about graphic design. It really saves you time, especially if you don't have any. 
You get in return, a beautiful, competitive, and immersive website that you would see on other professional corporate websites
all for the investments of time and frustration. Using raw HTML and CSS would take up a lot of time compared to using Semantic.
For example, if you wanted to create a dropdown menu using raw HTML and CSS, that would take about 100 lines of HTML and CSS code
combined. However, if you were to use semantic, you can achieve the same result with just HTML code and replace the CSS code with
two words, "ui dropdown" and it would basically do all your CSS formatting for you. Just like how you would use functions from a
library in Java or C++, it works in a very similar way. Instead of hard coding everything, you can just use a pre-made function
or class that achieves the same result and save you time.

In my personal perspective, I felt as though learning Semantic UI was a big jump for me from just using plain HTML and CSS. As
we were going through the WODS, from the basic HTML to HTML/CSS to HTML/CSS with Semantic UI. I started seeing the differences
between each WOD, especially from HTML/CSS to HTML/CSS with Semantic UI. I can see myself using some type of 
framework in the future as a software engineer or developer. Semantic UI is worth learning and so are other frameworks
depending on what you like and works for you as well as that you want because of the framework. 

In conclusion, I feel that frameworks in general are very useful for software engineers. Especially to those who don't have the 
time or don't want to invest in the time to learn about graphic design and save as much time as possible. Learning frameworks
may be complicated to learn, but it is simple to master. The results that you get when you invest in the time and frustration
is worth it.
